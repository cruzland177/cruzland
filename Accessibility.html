<p>Accessibility Statement


At CruzLand, we are committed to making our website accessible and usable for all people, including those with disabilities.



Our Efforts


We strive to follow best practices for website accessibility, including:

Providing clear, readable fonts

Using high-contrast text and background colors

Ensuring the website is navigable with a keyboard

Adding descriptive labels to form elements



Third-Party Tools


Some parts of our site, such as the contact form (powered by Formspree) or embedded maps, may rely on third-party providers. While we do our best to ensure accessibility, we cannot guarantee the accessibility of those external services.



Ongoing Improvements


We continue working to improve accessibility across our website. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let us know.
